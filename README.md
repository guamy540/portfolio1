I originally designed this project to be advertise my services as a web developr to local businesses. I've since repurposed it to function as a personal site to advertise myself as a full stack software developer as I apply to internships. 

This site was made using React and bootstrapped with create-react-app. SASS was used for styling so I could practice using a new CSS extension language. 

I used Sanity as a headless content management system so I could easily add projects and skills as my portfolio grows. The schema's I developed can be found in backend_sanity. My email is attached to the Sanity project, so I'm able to access it by moving to the ./portfolio1/backend_sanity folder in the terminal and typing the command 'sanity start' and then going to localhost:3333. Obviously, for security reasons, this is not accessible to any other user.

Additional packages/libraries include react-icons, EmailJS to handle sending emails, and framer-motion to animate the site.

TO RUN THIS APP:
You can see the hosted version of this site at https://www.sitesbyryan.com/
Alternatively, make sure you have Node.js installed on your PC, make sure you are in the project directory (the same directory as that containing the src folder) and run 'npm install' in the terminal. You can then run the site via the command 'npm start'. You should then have a browser open up at localhost:3000.
